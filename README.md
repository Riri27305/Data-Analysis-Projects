## 📁 Project Structure

```bash
├── main.ipynb         # Main Jupyter notebook with complete analysis
├── result.csv         # Final output with predicted sentiment labels
├── README.md          # Project overview and documentation


🚀 Features
Cleans and preprocesses social media text data (removes noise, symbols, stopwords, etc.)
Implements sentiment classification using Machine Learning models
Visualizes sentiment distribution across datasets
Evaluates model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

🧠 Technologies Used
Python (v3.7+)
Pandas, NumPy – Data manipulation
NLTK, re – Text preprocessing
Scikit-learn – Model building & evaluation
Matplotlib, Seaborn – Data visualization
Jupyter Notebook – Development environment

🛠 How to Run
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/social-media-sentiment-analysis.git
cd social-media-sentiment-analysis

Run the notebook:
jupyter notebook main.ipynb

📈 Sample Output
The final output file result.csv contains:

Post	Sentiment
"I love this product!"	Positive
"Worst service ever. So rude!"	Negative
"It’s okay, nothing special."	Neutral

📊 Model Performance
Accuracy: XX%
F1 Score: XX%
Detailed confusion matrix and classification report are available in main.ipynb.

🔮 Future Improvements
Integration with live Twitter API for real-time analysis
Advanced models like BERT or LSTM for better accuracy
